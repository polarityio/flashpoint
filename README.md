# Polarity - Flashpoint Integration

The Flashpoint API empowers experienced and entry-level users with the context they need to make better risk decisions about relevant threats such as cybercrime, fraud, and physical threats.

The Polarity Flashpoint integration allows Polarity to search Flashpoint's Indicators API to return threat information on IP's, Domains and File Hashes.

### Ignore List 

This is an alternate option that can be used to specify domains or IPs that you do not want sent to Flashpoint.  The data must specify the entire IP or domain to be blocked (e.g., www.google.com is treated differently than google.com).

This option allows you to specify a regex to set domains.  Any domain matching the regex will not be looked up.
